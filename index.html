        Let's get to know each other better. I will tell a little more about my
        pet
      </h3>

            Kisa was born in 2008 in my cousin's family. It had 2 more sisters
            and all 3 kittens were sorted at once. I was quite sad, because the
            kittens were incredibly cute and funny. However, a month later, my
            future pet was returned. The reason was the energetic and
            unpredictable behavior of the kitten.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <p class="right-rounded shadow">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-paw me-2"></i>
            My pet is a Siamese cat with blue eyes. It so happened that Kisa's
            mother was a white purebred cat, and its father was a real Siamese
            cat who lived next door. By mixing two breeds together, a very
            beautiful animal came out, which mesmerized absolutely everyone who
            came to visit me.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <p class="right-rounded shadow">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-paw me-2"></i>
            It was absolutely fantastic, in two seconds it climbed onto the
            curtains on the windows and jumped onto the cabinet that was
            standing next to it. Her favorite pastime, obviously, was drinking
            water from the aquarium. We loved doing everything together. We did
            homework, ate ice cream, slept, ran, had a lot of fun.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col-4">
          <p class="left-rounded shadow">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-paw me-2"></i>
            It almost never left the apartment and therefore took care of it as
            if it were its own. Not a single bug or fly stayed with us for long.
            It organized a real hunt for insects, hid in a hole or jumped like a
            spider man on the walls. It was even forbidden for pigeons to sit on
            the other side of the window.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <p class="left-rounded shadow">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-paw me-2"></i>
            However, it is worth telling that my pet's behavior was sometimes
            difficult. It did not like guests in the house and reacted to
            strangers by hissing and running with a bent back. It sensed the
            veterinarian even at the door of the clinic. And in everyday life,
            it can easily kick me by paw if it wanted to.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <p class="left-rounded shadow">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-paw me-2"></i>
            Everyone wanted to stroke it or hold it, but Kisa's strict character
            was manifested at such moments and it was impossible to do it.
            Nevertheless, our cat makes every day special. When sad, it starts
            playing with us. Or, just soak in bed next to a ragged animal.
